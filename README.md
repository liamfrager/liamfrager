# Hello! 👋
My name is Liam Frager! 😄



## 📝 Here's a bit about me
I am a detail-oriented software developer with a strong track record in full-stack development. 💪 Passionate about implementing scalable, elegant solutions using a diverse range of languages and frameworks, I am a collaborative team player with excellent communication and project management skills, committed to continuous learning. 📚

In addition to coding, I have a passion for music. 🎶 I play several instruments (mostly piano 🎹), and am often composing music in my free time. 🎼 Some of my favorite composers include **Sergei Prokofiev** 🎻, **Stephen Sondheim** 🎭, and **John Williams** 🎬.



## 🎓 I also went to school
